# Agrinet

This is the first full fledged webiste that me (Harsh Mallick) and my team-mate (Piyush Raj) have made using MERN Stack.
The aim of the website is to connect the Farmers, Buyers, Transporters and Cold Storage owners making it easy for farmers to sell and store their purchased grains. The webiste also helps to eliminate middle-man offring maximum price according to the quality of crop.
